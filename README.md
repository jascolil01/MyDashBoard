# About

Hello, I am Joshua Ascolillo. This is my repo for the website I built in **MEVN (Mongo, Express, Vuejs, Nodejs)** format. 

# Functionality

[Navigate to the website here](https://joshdashboard.herokuapp.com)

This application will allow you to keep track of your daily life activities. Want to make a todo list? Want to make a budget? need to do some quick math? or maybe even list out and keep track of hobbies? this application will do all of that for you. One last aspect of this page is that you will be able to interact with others on the site and make posts about your daily life if you so choose to! make an account and see what you can do.
